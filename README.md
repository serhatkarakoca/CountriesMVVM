## CountriesMVVM

This application shows the countries and their details such as capital city , currency. 

### Introduction
It may seem like a simple application but it is written in mvvm architecture.
I used Retrofit and RxJava to get the Json data, Room to store, LiveData, Glide and Navigation.


We store the data gets by Retrofit in the room database,  
data updating by the room database within 10 minutes and reflect to the user also the user can update data from the API by swiping. We also show data with recyclerview.
